echo "🧪 ANTHONY PROJECT - COMPREHENSIVE TESTING GUIDE"
echo "=================================================="
echo ""

echo "📋 TESTING CHECKLIST:"
echo "====================="
echo ""

echo "1. 🔧 BASIC FUNCTIONALITY TEST"
echo "   ✓ Open: http://localhost:5174/anthony_project/"
echo "   ✓ Verify: Page loads without console errors"
echo "   ✓ Check: Static menu displays correctly"
echo "   ✓ Verify: No React Hooks Rule violations"
echo ""

echo "2. 🎛️ CMS TOGGLE TEST"
echo "   ✓ Locate: CMS toggle switch in menu section"
echo "   ✓ Action: Toggle from 'Static Menu' to 'CMS Menu'"
echo "   ✓ Verify: Firebase initializes only when CMS is enabled"
echo "   ✓ Check: No 'INTERNAL ASSERTION FAILED' errors"
echo "   ✓ Monitor: Singleton pattern prevents duplicate instances"
echo ""

echo "3. 🔥 FIREBASE DEBUG MODE TEST"
echo "   ✓ Action: Press Ctrl+M to enter Firebase Debug Mode"
echo "   ✓ Verify: Debug page loads without errors"
echo "   ✓ Click: 'Test Firebase Connection' button"
echo "   ✓ Check: Controlled Firebase initialization"
echo "   ✓ Verify: No conflicts with Menu component"
echo ""

echo "4. 🖼️ IMAGE LOADING TEST"
echo "   ✓ Verify: Static menu images load from Unsplash"
echo "   ✓ Check: No 404 errors for placeholder images"
echo "   ✓ Monitor: All images display correctly"
echo ""

echo "5. ⚠️ ERROR HANDLING TEST"
echo "   ✓ Verify: ErrorBoundary components are active"
echo "   ✓ Test: Error recovery mechanisms"
echo "   ✓ Check: User-friendly error messages"
echo ""

echo "📊 EXPECTED CONSOLE OUTPUT:"
echo "=========================="
echo ""
echo "✅ GOOD SIGNS:"
echo "   - '🏗️ Creating new MenuSDK instance for: [restaurantId]'"
echo "   - '♻️ Reusing existing MenuSDK instance for: [restaurantId]'"
echo "   - '✅ Firebase initialized successfully'"
echo "   - '📊 Firebase references: [number]'"
echo ""
echo "❌ BAD SIGNS TO AVOID:"
echo "   - 'FIRESTORE INTERNAL ASSERTION FAILED'"
echo "   - 'React has detected a change in the order of Hooks'"
echo "   - '404 (Not Found)' for images"
echo "   - 'Should have a queue. You are likely calling Hooks conditionally'"
echo ""

echo "🛠️ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "===================="
echo ""
echo "1. ✅ Fixed React Hooks Rule Violation"
echo "   - useMenuIntegration always called (never conditionally)"
echo "   - Added 'enabled' parameter for controlled initialization"
echo ""
echo "2. ✅ Implemented Firebase Singleton Pattern"
echo "   - MenuSDKManager prevents duplicate instances"
echo "   - Improved Firebase manager with better error handling"
echo ""
echo "3. ✅ Enhanced Error Handling"
echo "   - Added ErrorBoundary components"
echo "   - Better error messages for Firebase issues"
echo "   - Graceful fallback mechanisms"
echo ""
echo "4. ✅ Optimized CMS Loading"
echo "   - CMS disabled by default to prevent conflicts"
echo "   - User-controlled CMS activation"
echo "   - Proper cleanup on component unmount"
echo ""

echo "🚀 TESTING COMMANDS:"
echo "==================="
echo ""
echo "# Check for any remaining errors in key files"
echo "echo 'Checking for syntax errors...'"
echo ""
echo "# Monitor real-time logs (run in separate terminal)"
echo "echo 'Monitor browser console for real-time feedback'"
echo ""
echo "# Test Firebase connection manually"
echo "echo 'Use Firebase Debug Mode (Ctrl+M) for manual testing'"
echo ""

echo "🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA:"
echo "==================="
echo ""
echo "✅ Page loads without React Hooks errors"
echo "✅ CMS toggle works smoothly"
echo "✅ Firebase initializes only when needed"
echo "✅ No duplicate Firebase instances"
echo "✅ Images load correctly"
echo "✅ Error boundaries catch and handle errors gracefully"
